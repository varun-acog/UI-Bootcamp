    <h1>Classless CSS</h1>

    <section>
      <p>
        Classless CSS is about styling HTML elements directly without using
        classes or IDs. This minimalistic approach is suitable for small
        projects or quick prototypes.
      </p>
    </section>
    <h2>Below are my approaches for the different levels:</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Level 1 - Basic Styling</h3>
      <p>
        In this level, we styled the blog post using element selectors to
        center-align the content and apply basic margins. Itâ€™s a simple and
        clean approach.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Level 2 - Additional Elements</h3>
      <p>
        We added a list, blockquote, and inline code snippet. Element selectors
        were used to style them, keeping the page clean without extra markup.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Level 3 - Classless Framework</h3>
      <p>
        We explored frameworks like
        <a href="https://classless.de/">classless.de</a> for styling. Using
        these frameworks helped enhance the design without adding custom
        classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using <a href="https://classless.de/">classless.de</a> framework limited
        the customization.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Challenges faced:</h2>
      <p>
        We have multiple paragraphs, and if we want to style the second
        paragraph differently, without classes or IDs, we would have to rely on
        nth-of-type, which I felt tricky if the layout changes.
